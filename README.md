# AR-eyewear-master

AR-eyewear-master or NEUX it's a project that uses AI through OpenCV to break the barrier between the consumers buying glasses and the virtual stores giving them a way to try pairs of glasses on a web-based application using their webcams. 

Before developing this experiment the team did a mini round of interviews reaching about 50 different and unrelated persons and this was one of the most frequent problem among them.

This demo runs on Python using the OpenCV library for Face Recognition using Haar-Cascades to track the faces and apply the filters.

Right now the app is running OK but with some major issues that needs to be solved.

1.- The model struggles to keep tracking the faces when turning to the sides and this is a must.

2.- Wrap everything into a web-based app using a framework like Flask or Django
